## BACKLOG:

A collection of user stories you can choose from. Stories inside of each priority level are not necessarily in order. You and your team will decide when to develop each story by drawing out your Story Sequencing.

## USER STORY:

In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system.

## Must-Haves

> are necessary for basic usability:

| user story id | user story | acceptance criteria |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| US01          |    As a user, I expect there to be a navigation bar on the first login to the website that shows what the website contains.        |               When the user comes to the website, user must see a menu where she can easily navigate between the pages.      |
| US02          |   As a user, I would like to see the most important service or content offered by the website on the homepage.         |       When the user comes to the website, user must see the summary of the website on the homepage and is directed to the related pages such as 'See More' or 'Buy', 'Register', etc. to get more information and services.              |
| US03          |  As a user, I want the website to open quickly.          |       If the page opens for more than 3 seconds when the user comes to the website, 30% of the users leave the site. Website code must be written optimized, to avoid possible delays.              |
| US04          |    As a user, when I come to the site, I want the writing style to be legible and to have language options to understand.        |              A website must have a legible, eye-pleasing writing style and the language options of the audience it addresses.       |
## Should-Haves

> will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

| user story id | user story | acceptance criteria |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| US01          |   As a user, I would like the pages I click on from the homepage to contain sufficient information and the page to be user-oriented coded to get more information.         |       All pages of the website should be designed in a user-oriented manner and contain information that will be needed.              |
| US02          |       As a user, I want to see how many statistics of the product or service I will buy. For example how many Deployment, Published and project are there?     |            The relevant statistics of the product should be shown so that the user can trust the product to be purchased.         |
| US03          |   As a user, I want to see which languages the tool supports on the first page (such as Node.js, Php, Python).         |           In order for the user to start using the product, it should first be shown which languages are supported by it.          |
| US04          |    As a user, I want to see their contact information to get more information from the company such as email and social media accounts.        |            The contact information of a website should be included in the header or footer section that users can easily access.         |
## Could-Haves

> would be really cool to develop if there's time:

| user story id | user story | acceptance criteria |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| US01          |  As a user, I want to read the contents with visual shows rather than a simple site.          |       A website could have various CSS animations to grab users' attention.              |
| US02          |     As a user, I want to register as a user on the site and I would like to see the transactions I have done on this website before in my account.       |        A website could have user registration and login sections.             |
| US03          |       As a user, I want to hear from updates or discounts on the website.     |          The website could have had a mail newsletter to notify curious users. Therefore, the website could have a newsletter where users could leave their mail.           |
