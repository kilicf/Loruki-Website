# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

* We managed to do all the tasks required for this project.

## Stop Doing

<!--
  what did your group do that did not go very well
  agree to stop doing this in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - pushing changes directly to master/main branch
  - claiming more issues at once than you can finish
-->

* One task per person: when a task is realized only by one person the rest of the group won't fully understand.

## Continue Doing

<!--
  what did your group that worked well
  agree to keep doing these in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - making small, well-named commits
  - using the `help-wanted` label
-->

## Start Doing

<!--
  what ideas does your group have for making a better project next time?
  agree to give these things a try in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - use @mentions more often
  - use the github integration in slack. /github
-->

* Have group meetings as soon as we are all available;
* Discuss all the steps together;
* Ask for help without hesitation (It's normal to feel lost 😁! Trust a professional in that field 🤣);
* Work on each step together;

## Learned Lessons

<!--
  what cool things or general lessons has your team learned?
  This can be about anything! code, collaboration, git, github, ...
-->

* Everyday we learn some new Github features;
* New Html and Css commands.
