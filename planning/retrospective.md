# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->
Our Project Board was similar to our Development Strategy. Everything what we planed was done!

## Stop Doing

<!--
  what did your group do that did not go very well
  agree to stop doing this in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - pushing changes directly to master/main branch
  - claiming more issues at once than you can finish
-->
We have better to plan, because our planning was not good. We started to late on Wednesday and not everybody was included.

## Continue Doing

<!--
  what did your group that worked vwell
  agree to keep doing these in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - making small, well-named commits
  - using the `help-wanted` label
-->
Every single day we had comunication about our project and we agree to keep doing these.

## Start Doing
